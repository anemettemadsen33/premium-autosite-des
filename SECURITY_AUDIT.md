## Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-26  
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Current Status

- ✅ **2 Low Severity**: Fixed via `npm audit fix`
- ⚠️ **6 Moderate Severity**: Development dependencies only (accepted risk)

## Fixed Vulnerabilities

### 1. brace-expansion (Low)
- **Issue**: Regular Expression Denial of Service vulnerability
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed
- **Action**: Updated via `npm audit fix`

### 2. @eslint/plugin-kit (Low)
- **Issue**: Regular Expression Denial of Service attacks through ConfigCommentParser
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

## Remaining Vulnerabilities

### esbuild and related dependencies (6 Moderate)
- **Affected**: esbuild, vite, vite-node, vitest, @vitest/mocker, @vitest/ui
- **Issue**: Development server vulnerability allowing websites to send requests
- **Risk Assessment**: LOW - Only affects development environment
- **Justification**:
  - These are development-only dependencies
  - Not included in production builds
  - Development environments are not exposed to public internet
  - Would require force update with breaking changes
- **Mitigation**:
  - Don't run development server on public networks
  - Use production builds for deployment
  - Monitor for security updates

## Production Deployment

For production deployment:
1. ✅ Use `npm run build` to create production bundle
2. ✅ Deploy only the `dist/` folder
3. ✅ Development dependencies are NOT included in production
4. ✅ No known vulnerabilities in production dependencies

## Monitoring

- Dependabot configured for daily updates
- CI pipeline runs `npm audit` on every commit
- Security advisories monitored via GitHub

## Next Steps

1. Monitor for non-breaking updates to Vite/Vitest
2. Update when stable versions are available
3. Re-run audit after each dependency update
