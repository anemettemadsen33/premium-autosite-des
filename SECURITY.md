## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Premium Autosite, please report it to us through coordinated disclosure.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, please report security issues via one of the following methods:

1. **Email**: Send details to the repository maintainers
2. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use the "Security" tab in this repository

### What to Include

Please include as much of the following information as possible to help us better understand and resolve the issue:

- **Type of issue** (e.g., XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, authentication bypass)
- **Full paths of source file(s)** related to the manifestation of the issue
- **Location of the affected source code** (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Any special configuration** required to reproduce the issue
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact of the issue**, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of report
- **Assessment**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline**: Varies by severity
  - Critical: 24-48 hours
  - High: 7 days
  - Medium: 30 days
  - Low: 90 days

## Security Best Practices

This project implements the following security measures:

### Frontend Security
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated using Zod schemas
- **XSS Protection**: React's built-in XSS protection via JSX escaping
- **CSRF Protection**: Token-based authentication (when backend is implemented)
- **Content Security Policy**: Recommended CSP headers for production deployment

### Dependencies
- **Automated Updates**: Dependabot configured for daily npm updates
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: GitHub security advisories enabled
- **Audit Scripts**: Regular `npm audit` runs in CI pipeline

### Build & Deployment
- **CI/CD Security**: All builds run through GitHub Actions with security checks
- **Environment Variables**: No secrets committed to version control
- **HTTPS Only**: All production deployments must use HTTPS

### Code Quality
- **Linting**: ESLint configured to catch potential security issues
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript strict mode enabled
- **Testing**: Unit and integration tests for critical paths

## Known Security Considerations

### Client-Side Application
This is a frontend application that requires a secure backend API for production use:

1. **Authentication**: Implement secure JWT or session-based authentication on backend
2. **Authorization**: Backend must validate all user permissions
3. **Data Validation**: Never trust client-side validation alone
4. **Rate Limiting**: Implement on backend to prevent abuse
5. **API Security**: Use HTTPS, CORS, and proper authentication

### Dependencies
- Regular dependency updates via Dependabot
- Critical vulnerabilities addressed within 48 hours
- Non-critical updates reviewed and applied monthly

## Security Checklist for Production

Before deploying to production, ensure:

- [ ] All environment variables are properly secured
- [ ] HTTPS is enforced
- [ ] CSP headers are configured
- [ ] Backend API has proper authentication
- [ ] Rate limiting is implemented
- [ ] Input validation on both client and server
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive information
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date
- [ ] Security headers are configured (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- [ ] Regular security audits are scheduled

## Responsible Disclosure

We kindly ask security researchers to:

1. Allow us reasonable time to address vulnerabilities before public disclosure
2. Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations and service disruption
3. Not access or modify other users' data
4. Not perform destructive testing (DoS, spam, etc.)

We commit to:

1. Respond to your report promptly
2. Keep you informed of our progress
3. Credit you for the discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
